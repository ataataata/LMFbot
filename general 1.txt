# **<u>General information about the Light Microscopy Facility (LMF)</u>**

## Microscopes we offer

As of November 2024, the UMass Amherst Light Microscopy Facility (LMF)
has almost 20 microscopes. Our scanning confocal microscopes consist of
A1SP, A1RSIM, A1R18, A1R25, A1RMP, and the AXR-NSpark.
The A1 series of confocal microscope are the older generation, and the
AX series is the newer one. The A1RMP is an upright microscope that
has both visible and infrared laser sources for either single or two
photon experiments. The facility also has three spinning disc confocal
microscopes, two of which are available to users and are called the
SDX1 and the Crest. We also have two Tirf microscopes, one which can
perform single molecule experiments (Storm, Palm, and DNApaint). We
also have a stereoscope called the SMZ18 which is good for macro
photography and is quantitative in both intensity and size measurements.
Our Keyence is a very easy to use epifluorescence and brightfield
microscope that allows for fluorescence and colorimetric imaging of
slides, dishes, or well plates.

## Image analysis server and software for users

The LMF also provides access to image analysis software. To use this,
you can request access to the Hive from LMF staff. On the Hive you will
find Nikon Elements Analysis packages including General Analysis 3
(GA3), deconvolution, as well as the ability to train your own AI to use
for segmentation, image clean up, etc. in your analysis pipeline. You
can run your analysis pipeline in batch mode so it works on its own
while you do more important work.

## If you have an emergency or need emergency assistance

If you get a cut or are hurt in some other way or if there is an emergency, let us know as soon as you are
safe or when no one else is in harms way. Please help yourself to the
emergency kit on the big table in the middle of the room. Depending on
the situation, contact EHS (4135452682, closing hours hotline
4135453630), UMass police department (4135453111), or the local
