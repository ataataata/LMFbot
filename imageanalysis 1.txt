# **<u>Image analysis server and questions and problems</u>**

## About the Hive image analysis server

There is a new Image Analysis server called LMF-Hive. It is accessible
via remote desktop interface and can handle up to 16 concurrent users.
It has 2.0 terabytes of RAM and five high-end GPU cards. It has various open-
and closed-source image analysis packages preinstalled for your usage.
If there is software that you need, please reach out to Jim Chambers to
discuss.

## How to use the Hive and Nikon Elements

<u>1) Make and begin your Core-Um reservation if using NIS Elements</u>

- We have 4 “seats” for Elements, each with GA3, AI, deconvolution, etc. All of
  them are equivalent and on the same machine.
- To use open source software, no need for Core-Um reservation for now.

<u>2) Connect to the Hive</u>

- Don’t skip this part – I am putting it here so you read it.
- For NIS Elements, <u>on first run</u> you will get a “low disk space
  error”.
- Type the letter Q
- At the bottom of the “General” tab, change the Temp folder to E:\Temp
- If you do not do this, Elements will crash

- If you don’t have it already, install Microsoft Remote Desktop client
  software on your Mac or PC.
- Note that we now offer in-person terminals to access the Hive on a big
  screen.
- Add a new PC connection and use this address:
  LMF-HIVE.CAMPUS.ADS.UMASS.EDU
- Connect to the “Hive” remote computer by logging in with your UMass
  credentials
- To connect from off-campus, you will need to install and use the UMass
  IT VPN.

<u>3) Use the analysis software of your choice</u>

- Select the software you need for your work – if missing, let LMF staff
  know, and we will install.

- Data can be ***<u>temporarily</u>*** stored on the data drive E in
  “Hive-User-Projects” and make a subfolder with your advisor’s last
  name.

- Data will be removed in a first-in, first-out scheme.****   
  **(i.e. don’t plan on finding your data here in 2 years)**
- **This is just for active data.**

- Make judicious use of the IALS-Core-Shared folder for data storage and
  movement.

<u>4) Moving data to/from the Y-drive</u>

- To connect to the Y-Drive server from a Mac, go to finder, then Go,
  then Connect to Server and type smb colon slash slash 172.19.83.114 in
  the box. Then enter your credentials.

- To connect to the server from a PC, go to file manager, then
  type \\172.19.83.114 in the top path bar.
  Then enter your credentials.


## How can I run batch analysis using GA3 in Nikon Elements?

To run GA3 in batch and get your results in a nice table, you need to
add Cumulative Results after you have accumulated your records in a
nicely formatted table. This will add a filename column when you run the
batch so you will know which file was the source for each group of data.

## Where should I be saving my data?

Save your data locally on the data drive of the microscope PC (Drive D,
E, F, G, or H: depending on the microscope.). Never ever save data to
the C drive as data found there is automatically and permanently deleted
to assure the system can run smoothly for everyone. When you are done
imaging, upload your data to a network location of your choice or use a
USB stick. When we need more space on the data drives, we delete the
oldest files first. Long term storage is not the responsibility of the
LMF. You should check with your advisor on their plan for data
management, accessibility, and storage.
