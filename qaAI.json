  {
    "q": "I am currently unable to use the A1-R-SIMe microscope due to an issue where it says, \"Unable to connect device EXFO X-Cite 120\".",
    "a": "You can ignore that error message as it will not affect confocal imaging. There is likely a loose connection at the back of the green and white box on the right side of the microscope. You are welcome to check those cables."
  },
  {
    "q": "When I run Nikon Elements, I get a startup error that says \"select the confocal simulator to be loaded\".",
    "a": "To resolve this, please close Nikon NIS-Elements, power off the Nikon A1 box at the back wall, then power it back on and relaunch the software. This error commonly occurs if the system was not shut down or started correctly."
  },
  {
    "q": "I just started up the Crest and I have a POST error saying fatal P-C-I error.",
    "a": "This is a common error that usually happens when the PC is turned on before the camera is fully powered on, causing the computer to crash. To fix this, please restart the startup procedure for the microscope. Make sure the computer is off as the first step, and after turning the camera on, wait about 2 minutes before powering up the PC."
  },
  {
    "q": "I am on the Crest and when I run Elements it says it can’t open camera device Prime 95B.",
    "a": "To resolve this, first, shut down Windows and wait for the PC lights to turn off completely. Then, turn off the camera if it is on. Turn the camera back on and wait about 2 minutes before turning the PC back on and launching the software again."
  },
  {
    "q": "I am having trouble with Nikon Elements crashing when I am analyzing images using the HIVE server.",
    "a": "This crashing is often caused by not setting your temporary directory in the settings. To fix this, double-click on the top bar of Elements, and at the bottom of the “General” tab, change the Temp folder to the “Temp” subdirectory found in the E-drive."
  },
  {
    "q": "I am using the Keyence microscope and when I try to run the Keyence Viewer software, I get a pop-up that says “Already running.”",
    "a": "To solve this problem, you will need to restart the PC. This will end the disconnected session."
  },
  {
    "q": "I can’t run Fiji on the HIVE because it is giving a “permission denied” error.",
    "a": "This is a known issue that happens with the auto-update feature. Please send a message to Jim, and he can update the software as an administrator to resolve the problem."
  },
  {
    "q": "When I try to use most of the features in Nikon Elements on the HIVE, they are all greyed out and not available. How can I fix this?",
    "a": "This often happens because some features, like analysis explorer, GA3, and the tracking module, require an image to be open before they are launched. Please try opening an image first."
  },
  {
    "q": "The microscope computer I am using says it needs to do a Windows update. What should I do?",
    "a": "You can pause the update during your imaging session. When you are finished, it would be helpful if you could restart the PC to apply the update."
  },
  {
    "q": "When I run Nikon Elements, I get a warning that another instance of the application is running. What should I do?",
    "a": "On a microscope PC, the quickest way to fix this is to restart the computer. This usually happens when a previous user did not close the application correctly. If you are on the HIVE, another user might still be using a license. You can check Corum to see who it might be and message them on Microsoft Teams."
  },
  {
    "q": "I’m getting a hardware error message when I run Nikon Elements.",
    "a": "This is usually because something is not turned on or was turned on in the wrong order. First, check that all numbered components of the microscope setup are on. If something is off, turn it on and restart Nikon Elements. If the problem continues, turn off the entire setup and restart, waiting ten seconds between turning on each numbered switch."
  },
  {
    "q": "I'm getting an error about the camera when I launch Nikon Elements.",
    "a": "This usually means the camera did not connect correctly. Please shut down the PC and wait for the lights to turn off. Then, turn the camera off and then back on, waiting for the blinking light on the back to stop. Finally, restart the PC."
  },
  {
    "q": "The program is running very slowly or is frozen.",
    "a": "If the software is frozen or slow, you should close it and reboot the PC, leaving all the hardware on. After the PC restarts, check if the C-drive is full. If it is, please contact the core staff. The reboot should free up RAM and solve the issue."
  },
  {
    "q": "How do I save the Maximum intensity projection (MIP) images as a tiff? It saves as a regular z-stack.",
    "a": "You are correct, it saves as a regular z-stack by default. To create and save a maximum intensity projection, go to \"Image\" > \"ND Processing,\" then select \"create max intensity projection\" and save that result."
  },
  {
    "q": "I could not see the signal and no excitation laser on the Flim system on the A1-S-P microscope. What should I do?",
    "a": "Please check that you have turned on the correct pulsed laser control unit, which is located to the left of the A1-S-P microscope."
  },
  {
    "q": "What is the pixel size for the CellCyte microscopes?",
    "a": "The pixel size for images from the CellCyte microscopes is 0.234 microns per pixel. This does not apply to other microscopes in the facility."
  },
  {
    "q": "How do I figure out the pixel size for images that I collected in the Light Microscopy Facility?",
    "a": "The pixel size is almost always stored in the image file's metadata. You can view this information using software like Nikon Elements or Fiji by looking for the term \"calibration\"."
  },
  {
    "q": "Is there a way to copy a portion of a GA3 recipe from one into another?",
    "a": "While there isn't an easy way to copy a part of a recipe, you can create a shared function by grouping part of a recipe. You can then call that function in other GA3 recipes."
  },
  {
    "q": "How can I figure out the pixel calibration or size for images from the Keyence microscope?",
    "a": "The metadata in TIFF files saved with the Keyence software is not compatible with Fiji or ImageJ, so the default calibration will be incorrect. To set an accurate scale bar, you need to manually enter the resolution in Fiji. First, find the resolution information in the Keyence analyzer under \"Insert\" > \"scale\" > \"calibration settings\". Then, in Fiji, go to \"Image\" > \"properties\" or \"Analyze\" > \"set scale\" and enter the number you found."
  },
  {
    "q": "I collected a large tiled image (10 by 10 array) and one of them has a repeating area. Why did this happen?",
    "a": "It seems the stage or sample did not move for the image with the repeats. This can happen when using an oil objective because the oil's high viscosity can drag the sample if it is not secured. To prevent this, you can use black painter's tape to hold the sample to the holder. You can find tape on the large table in the middle of the room or ask LMF staff for some."
  },
  {
    "q": "How can I run batch analysis using GA3 in Nikon Elements?",
    "a": "To run a batch analysis with GA3 and get your results in a table, you need to add \"Cumulative Results\" after accumulating your records. This will add a filename column to your results, so you know the source file for each data group."
  },
  {
    "q": "How can I change the display color of my image or channels?",
    "a": "In Nikon Elements, you can change the color for existing or future data. For existing data, right-click on the image channel tab at the bottom of the image, choose “properties,” and set your desired color. To change the color for future data on a confocal microscope, click \"Detector,\" then select the desired channel color. For other microscopes, right-click the optical configuration button, click “edit,” and choose your preferred color."
  },
  {
    "q": "How can I image more than four fluorophores?",
    "a": "For imaging four or more colors, we recommend consulting with LMF staff to minimize bleed-through. Generally, image your furthest red color first and your bluest color last to reduce photobleaching. Most of our microscopes can easily handle four fluorescent colors plus a transmitted channel. Some can do more with spectral imaging, fluorescence lifetime imaging, or special filter sets."
  },
  {
    "q": "Can I get confocal images of my color-stained sample with transmitted light?",
    "a": "Unfortunately, confocal imaging is only for fluorescent samples and cannot be done with bright-field settings. However, you can still acquire a z-stack with bright-field on almost all of our microscopes to get a 3D image, though the resolution will not be the same as a true confocal image. For non-fluorescently stained samples, the Keyence microscope is the best and easiest option to use."
  },
  {
    "q": "If I lost my settings or need starter optical configurations, what should I do?",
    "a": "To import starter settings in Nikon Elements, go to \"Calibration\" > \"Optical Configurations\" in the top menu. Click \"import\" and find the most recent XML file on the data drive. You can also import settings from old data by opening an ND2 file, right-clicking on the image, and choosing \"reuse camera settings\" and then \"reuse device settings\". Click \"add\" on the top right to save it as a new configuration."
  },
  {
    "q": "How can I display a scale bar or measure things in my image?",
    "a": "In Nikon software, click the scale bar icon on the right of your image to display it as a layer. For the Keyence Analyzer, go to \"Insert\" > \"Scale\". If you are using Fiji or ImageJ with Keyence data, you must manually enter the calibration since the metadata is not readable by other programs. In the Keyence Analyzer, find the calibration number (microns per pixel) under Insert > scale > Calibration \"Setting\". Then in Fiji/ImageJ, go to “Image” > “properties” and enter the converted value."
  },
  {
    "q": "How can I reorient or rotate my sample on the screen while imaging?",
    "a": "On a scanning confocal, go to the \"Scan area\". You can shrink the green box and then use the mouse to grab the green circle and rotate it to the desired angle. Right-click to send the new settings to the confocal hardware."
  },
  {
    "q": "My image looks grainy or has low resolution. What can I do?",
    "a": "This could be an issue with the sample, focus, or a system error. If you're sure the sample is in focus and fluorescent, check if there was an error when you booted the system. If so, restart the PC and the microscope controller box. If you cannot see fluorescence through the eyepiece, you likely won't see it in the software. Also, try cleaning the objective and the sample's cover glass."
  },
  {
    "q": "How can I improve my image resolution?",
    "a": "Often, what appears to be a resolution issue is actually a contrast or focus problem. Here are some steps to try: 1. Ensure the sample is in focus.2. Clean the cover glass.3. Clean the objectives with lens cleaner.4. Image your positive control samples first to confirm your sample is bright enough.5. Prepare a thinner sample.6. For higher resolution, consider using Nyquist sampling."
  },
  {
    "q": "Where should I be saving my data?",
    "a": "Save your data locally on the data drive of the microscope PC (D, E, F, G, or H drive). Never save data to the C drive, as it is automatically and permanently deleted. When you are finished, upload your data to a network location or use a USB drive. Long-term data storage is not the responsibility of the LMF, and we delete the oldest files from data drives when space is needed."
  },
  {
    "q": "A new user in my lab wants to get started with the Light Microscopy Facility. How should they proceed?",
    "a": "The easiest way to get them started is to have them email Jim. It's helpful to provide information about the type of data they hope to collect so we can guide them to the best microscopes for their research."
  },
  {
    "q": "I need to update my speed type number in Corum. Who can help me with that?",
    "a": "Your lab’s bookkeeper should be able to update this in Corum. If you have trouble, you can email Jim with the number, and he can activate you as a purchaser."
  },
  {
    "q": "Can I do live cell imaging with incubation?",
    "a": "Yes. If you need access to the stage-top incubators on Core-Um, please send a message to LMF staff on Teams. We have options for chamber slides, dishes, and well plates, and 5% carbon dioxide is available for reservation on Core-Um."
  },
  {
    "q": "How can I view my data on my own computer?",
    "a": "Most image files from the LMF are in formats like .ND2 that standard viewers can't open. We recommend two free solutions:\nFiji: An ImageJ distribution with plugins like Bio-Formats that can read most microscopy image formats.\nNikon NIS-Elements Viewer: A free program to view .ND2 files with the same look and feel as the full software, but without the advanced analysis features."
  },
  {
    "q": "I haven't used the microscope in a while. Is there a checklist to help me get started?",
    "a": "Yes, you can refer to the new user checklist. You can also find information in the \"files\" tab in the \"general\" channel on Microsoft Teams or contact LMF staff. You can also attend office hours for help with experimental design or software features."
  },
  {
    "q": "How can I get help with experimental plans?",
    "a": "We offer free consultations to all UMass Amherst community members. Please email us at lmf@umass.edu or message us on Microsoft Teams. We also have office hours and chat sessions available."
  },
  {
    "q": "Are there costs for training and assistance?",
    "a": "All LMF users are charged a training fee for each microscope they are trained on. After training is complete, a solo-use fee applies for future use. We also offer dedicated imaging services by staff for a fee. All rates can be found on our main website."
  },
  {
    "q": "What should I do if I run out of supplies like lens tissue or oil?",
    "a": "Please contact LMF staff via Microsoft Teams or email. If it's after hours or on a holiday, you can borrow supplies from a nearby microscope desk or the center table, but please still notify us so we can restock."
  },
  {
    "q": "How can I get help from a person?",
    "a": "The fastest way to get help from an LMF staff member is to send a message on Microsoft Teams by starting a new chat and typing \"LMFStaff\" in the \"to\" field. You will likely get a quick response during regular business hours."
